 * Animation Controller interface
 *
 * @remarks
 * This interface is used to control animations. It provides methods to start,
 * stop, pause, and restore animations. It also provides a way to wait for the
 * animation to stop.
 *
 * This interface extends the `IEventEmitter` interface, which means you can
 * listen to these events emitted by the animation controller:
 * - `animating` - Emitted when the animation finishes it's delay phase and
 *   starts animating.
 * - `stopped` - Emitted when the animation stops either by calling the `stop()`
 *    method or when the animation finishes naturally.

   * The Promise returned by this method is reset every time the animation
   * enters a new start/stop cycle. This means you must call `start()` before
   * calling this method if you want to wait for the animation to stop.
   *
   * This method always returns a resolved promise if the animation is currently
   * in a stopped state.
